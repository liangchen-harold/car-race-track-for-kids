## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Kids like to build toy cars with Lego, and always want to try it out. A track is a cool thing to play together.

I want to build a track to play with my kid, and I think it's fun if we can measure the speed of cars, so that we can dig into a lot of topics.

Here're some exampls:
* Building faster cars with hypothesis, experiment, analysis
* Data analysis with Python
